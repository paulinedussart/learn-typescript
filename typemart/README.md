# TypeMart Project Description 

Welcome to our new online shop: TypeMart! 

Weâ€™re ready to go liveâ€¦ well, almostâ€¦ Weâ€™re attempting to get this shop up and going, but we need your help to code a crucial piece of our online mart: **the purchase flow**!

We think youâ€™re the right person for the job because itâ€™s really important to us that the purchase flow is type-safe. (All that type safety will allow us to sleep well at night.)

Currently, we are producing a few types of products, and we canâ€™t wait to expand as we start to sell our first items. For our mart to be successful, weâ€™ll have to calculate the correct price for shoppers, in addition to applying any specials or other charges.

- ðŸ‘• Store the name of the product the user is trying to find. 
- ðŸ–¨ Few items are available for pre-orderâ€”shoppers, we want to notify the customer that weâ€™ll send them a message when their product ships.
- ðŸšš If the price of an item is over $25, we will provide free shipping.
- ðŸ’¸ Since our shop operates out of New York City, weâ€™re required to pay extra tax when someone from New York buys a product from TypeMart. 
- ðŸ‘› Calculate the total price.
